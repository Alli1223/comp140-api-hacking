# API Hacking
This is the base repository for the COMP140 API Hacking assignment.

NB: this repository current does not contain a `.gitignore` file. I recommend you use https://www.gitignore.io to generate an appropriate `.gitignore` file for your choice of implementation language and development environment.

## Proposal

For this project I am going to liaison for the BA team Gambit.
I will attempt to create a API for their game using the C# language and in unity.

##Ideas:
+ Implement Google Cloud API to save the unity's game save to their google drive account.

+ Get a weather API to change the weather state in the game to the current weather at the players location

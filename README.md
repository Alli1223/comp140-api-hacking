# API Hacking
This is the base repository for the COMP140 API Hacking assignment.

NB: this repository current does not contain a `.gitignore` file. I recommend you use https://www.gitignore.io to generate an appropriate `.gitignore` file for your choice of implementation language and development environment.

## Proposal

For this project I am going to liaison for the BA team Gambit.
I will attempt to create a API for their game using the C# language and in unity.

For my API project I am going to change the weather state in the game to the current weather at the players physical location IRL.

There are many different weather APIs that I could find, so for my first sprint I aim to have found the most appropriate weather API that could be integrated into the game.
